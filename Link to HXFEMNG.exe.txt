Some notes:

Purpose:
This program creates text files for use with HXFEMNG.exe from HxC Floppy Emulator project, (c) 2006-2017 Jean-François DEL NERO / (c) HxC2001

You can download it from: https://hxc2001.com/download/floppy_drive_emulator/SDCard_HxC_Floppy_Emulator_Manager.zip
(It was in the WINDOWS folder the least time I checked)



Usage:
This program is designed to synchronise a base (PC) directory with a USB Memory stick (HDD, thumbdrive etc.)

1) Set the source Directory (click the ... button and select your directory or paste in a valid path)

2) Click 'Populate' and this will show a flat view of all file types in that and all sub directories.

3) Add some disk images to the Export List.

4) Set the UDB Drive label from the drop down list.

5) Optionally tick 'Include Disk list'. This will create a list (without paths) of the disk images in your list.

6) Click 'Save List'. This creates a disk list, and automatically numbers each slot in the list.

7) Click 'Copy Games' to copy all games over to your USB Drive.

8) Run HXNMNG.EXE from the command line, ensuring the exe is not on the USB drive when you do. eg: HXCFEMNG.EXE -verbose -disk:I:  -setslots:<FILE_YOU_CREATED>
   This will edit the HXCSDFE.CFG on the root of the I: drive, and set the slots as per your file.



Setup:
1) Extract the files HXNMNG.EXE, SDL.dll and readme.txt into a working folder.

2) Copy a DROP_TXT_HERE-DRIVE_<DRIVE_LETTER>.bat if you prefer.

3) Run the MakeHXCList, and create a txt file.

4) Run the HXCFEMNG.EXE, eg: HXCFEMNG.EXE -verbose -disk:I:  -setslots:<FILE_YOU_CREATED> or drop the txt file on the drive letter batch file of your USB drive.
